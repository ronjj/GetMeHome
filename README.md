# **GetMeHome**

GetMeHome aggregates trip information across MegaBus, FlixBus, and OurBus. I was motivated to create this package after booking trips to travel from Ithaca, NY to New York City. To make the process easier I developed GetMeHome.

**Backend**:

- Python for requests and scraping information from APIs and web pages
